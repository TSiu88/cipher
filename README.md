# _Simple Cipher_

#### _Exercise in Javascript Functions and String Methods, 01.13.2020_

#### By _**Tiffany Siu and Krista Rutz**_

## Description

This exercise is to practice writing functions in Javascript and using String methods to manipulate string input into an encoded sentence.  The program takes a sentence from user input and does a series of methods to encode it.  Then both the original and encoded sentence can be viewed.

## Specifications

* _Prompt user to enter a sentence_

* _First and last letter of sentence is capitalized and returned as a new string_
  * _Example Input: "how are you"_
  * _Example Output: "HU"_
* _The first and last letters from the previous step are reversed and added back to the original sentence_
  * _Example Input: "how are you" and "HU"_

* _Count the number of letters in the original sentence and divide by two (rounded down), take the character at that position and add to the front of encrypted string_
  * _Example Input: "how are youUH"_
  * _Example Output: "rhow are youUH"_
* _Take the result of all previous steps and reverse the string_
  * _Example Input: "rhow are youUH"_
